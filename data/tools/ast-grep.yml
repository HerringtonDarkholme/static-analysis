  ast-grep is a powerful tool designed for managing code at scale using
  Abstract Syntax Trees (AST). Think of it as a hybrid of grep, eslint, and codemod,
  with the ability to search, lint, and rewrite code based on its structure rather than plain text.

  It supports multiple languages and is designed to be extensible, allowing you to register custom languages.
